                    Hello I am one of the groups front-end programmers of the
                    project. My role was to retrieve data from public APIâ€™s
                    using redux to visualize covid-19 statistics. Alongside
                    Tejinderjeet Sandhu we implemented various graphs to the

                    Hi my name is Tejinderjeet Sandhu, everyone knows me as Tj.
                    I am the Assistant Project Manager and one of the Senior
                    Frontend Web Developers for the Health Solutions Detectives
                    team. I worked with Alfredo Mora and Hector Carbajal to
                    implement/integrate different web components. I also worked
                    on parsing through COVID data to create new ways to display
                    the data in a meaningful way. Lastly, together with advice
                    from the team, I feel that we Frontend Engineers have truly
                    created a web app that will help progress the fight with
                    COVID-19.

                    Hello, my name is Hugo. I was the only Backend Engineer for
                    this project. I implemented the user authentication for the
                    site, as well as the firebase implementation of the project.
                    I introduced the usage of redux and middleware to the team.
                    Delegated tasks and expectations where needed. Worked with
                    the two main frontEnd engineers who provided all the
                    frontend contributions that backend needed communication
                    with, Project Manager: Alfredo Mora, Assistant Manager:

                    Hello folx! My name is Michelle, and I am a recent Junior
                    Honors transfer student at CSU San Bernardino. As part of my
                    undergraduate journey, I am pursuing a double major in both
                    Nursing and Computer Systems (concentration in Systems
                    Administration) as well as a Psychology minor. With
                    considering my future career/professional goals: to become a
                    Nurse Informaticist, it only made it more of a compelling
                    reason to contribute towards designing a web application
                    with focus on preventative measures and easy-to-understand,
                    graphical representations of COVID-19-related statistics
                    that both provide credible and up-to-date data. With not
                    having had previous front-end development experience, it
                    definitely was a providential opportunity to serve as the
                    Front-End Developer of the team and to be able to work with
                    such an inspiring and impactful team and excellent Project
                    Managers who secured the scaffoldings of this web
                    application. A few key highlights of my contribution to the
                    COVID-19 Forecast Tracker web application include rendering
                    a pie chart that displays distribution (in percentage) of
                    COVID-19 severity impact relative to race and population
                    within Los Angeles County and compiling credible COVID-19
                    community/social services resources, relevant COVID-19 news
                    articles, as well as peer-reviewed research reports which
                    cover topics such as current vaccines in clinical trials or
                    therapeutics under research. I hope that you find this
                    website useful and hope that this website can help you
                    better understand how to protect yourself, your community,
                    and your family from COVID-19.
